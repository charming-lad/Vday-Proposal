      <small>I had a rumour from someone that you think I don't like you anymore.
        So this is for you my girl.‚ù§Ô∏è</small>
    </div>
    <div>
      <small> Our perfect date could be when I'll be making your favorite cuisine and we review it together, after that a walk with random conversations would be fun.   </small>
    </div>
    <div>
      <small> However,  movie & üçø date is always an option.  </small>
    </div>
    <div>
      <small> Or we can have a photoshoot date, coz I'm good at it. </small>
    </div>
    <div>
      <small> We can definitely vibe with conversation including flora and fauna, movies and series, sports, traveling. </small>
    </div>
    <div>
      <small> I don't know whether I am your type or not but you are definitely my type. So I want to take you out on date. I know our date will not be on valentine's day and I apologize for it and I will make up for it with lots of gifts which you already know.
      So,
                ‚ù§Ô∏èWILL YOU BE MY VALENTINE ?‚ù§Ô∏è
